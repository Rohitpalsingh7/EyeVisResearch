## Design and Technical Innovtions and Future work

# Related Work : 

- The heatmap function is a huge departure from the documented examples that exist for D3.
- Variables were created for many of the different options to allow for future features to be added as needed, or if                requested, this ranges from color options, to grid size and resolution options.
- Prior work has been done to create gaze points and fixation points along with saccade.
- We conducted research and proposed different effective visualizations for eye tracking that includes contour map , blur map and coordinates map.
